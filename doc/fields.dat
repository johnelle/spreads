.. |iso| replace:: The ISO sensitivity value as a whole number. Default is 80.

.. |shutter-speed| replace:: The desired shutter speed as a fractional value. Default is 1/25.
   The equivalent key in the configuration file is `shutter_speed`.

.. |zoom-level| replace:: The desired zoom-level as a whole number. Default 
     is 3. Make sure that this value is supported by your camera, or else you will get an error.
     The equivalent key in the configuration file is `zoom_level`.
   
.. |dpi| replace:: The resolution in dots per inch that the camera captures at the given
   zoom level. Default is 300. You can determine this value yourself by
   taking a picture of an object with known dimensions, measuring its size
   in pixels and calculate the dots per inch from that.

.. |shoot-raw| replace:: Shoot RAW images instead of JPEG. Please note that this setting is
   **highly experimental** at the moment and RAW files are not supported
   by the postprocessing and output plugins as of now.
   The equivalent key in the configuration file is `shoot_raw`.

.. |focus-distance| replace:: This option allows the user to set a fixed 
   focus distance for the cameras by specifying a whole number which 
   represents the mm from the camera lens to the scanned object   
   This value can be obtained and automatically
   set in the configuration file by running the `configure` command and
   following the instructions. By default, this value is set to `auto` (0),
   which means that the camera will automatically re-focus for each capture,
   which might give problems when there is no text or images in the center
   of the image. You can set both cameras to the same value or set each
   individually. The equivalent key in the configuration file is `focus_distance`

.. |chdkptp-path| replace:: Specify where the application can locate the `chdkptp` files. By default
   this is `/usr/local/lib/chdkptp`.
