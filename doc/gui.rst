Graphical Interface
===================

Installation
------------
To enable the GUI wizard, first make sure that you have an up-to date version
of PySide installed on your machine.

Then, just re-run the *configure* step and add *gui* to your list of plugins.


Startup and Configuration
-------------------------
You can launch the GUI with the following command::

    $ spread gui

.. _gui-ref:
	
Interface
---------
On the :ref:`first screen <config_page>`, you can adjust various settings for
your scan. You have to specify a project directory before you can continue. The
rest of the settings depends on which plugins you have enabled. Select the
plugin to configure from the dropdown menu and make your adjustments.

   Initial setup page

:ref:`After you've clicked *next*<capture_page>`, the cameras will be prepared
for capture by setting their zoom and focus levels. At the top of the screen
you can see how many pages you've already scanned, as well as your current
average scanning speed. The text box at the bottom of the screen will display
any warnings or error messages that occur during the capture process. Next,
initiate a capture by clicking on the button (or pressing one of the capture
keys).

   Capture page

Once you have :ref:`captured your first pages<capture_page_images>`, you will
see the last two pages your cameras shot. Here you can verify that everything
went as expected. Should you notice a mistake, you can discard the previous
shot and retake it by clicking on the *retake* button.

Once you've finished scanning your book and :ref:`clicked on the *next*
button,<postprocess_page>` spreads will execute all enabled postprocessing
plugins in the sequence that you configured. You can verify the progress in the
text box.

   Postprocessing page

:ref:`Last<output_page>`, spreads will assemble the processed scans into your
enabled output formats. As in the postprocessing step, follow the progress via
the text box.
